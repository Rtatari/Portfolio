          <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p> Ciconia is a minimalist table lamp that can
                be lowered or raised, or angled to fit the
                user’s tastes. This lamp combines wood and
                plaster to create a design product which
                incorporates adjustability with a minimal
                amount of pieces. In addition, the lamp’s
                interaction uses a dimmer to turn on and off
                the lamp and control the brightness, and
                uses a LED strip to project light in a
                concentrated area. Its smaller size as a desk
                lamp allows for effortless portability.

            <p>
                Jennifer is a 26 year old graduate student in
                SIAT at SFU. She is very busy studying for
                her courses and also with her teacher
                assistant position for IAT 309, a writing
                course which includes marking a lot of
                papers. She enjoys reading books in her
                spare time, therefore the lamp should be
                adjustable and is easy to move around to
                her different reading spots. Jennifer also
                does her TA work at night most of the time
                so she needs a table lamp that provides a
                comfortable brightness level for her needs.

        <h2> Form & Process </h2>
          <p>
              We first found inspiration in simple shapes,
              and aimed to establish a minimal lamp that
              would be clear to use. From initial
              iterations, the form was not dynamic,
              therefore we explored angles and adjusted
              our base shape. The exposed wire shows
              clarity and honesty to the table lamp. Our
              final form resembles a crane, but holds a
              light at the end of its horizontal arm.

        <h2>Technology</h2>

          <p>
            To turn on and off the Ciconia lamp, we
            used a LED dimmer and the user can also
            use the dimmer to adjust the brightness of
            the light. We used a LED strip for our light
            source because it is energy efficient and
            flexible. To power the lamp, we used a
            plug-in power adapter because the user
            may need to use the lamp for a long time
            and it is a convenient way of getting
            electricity.
