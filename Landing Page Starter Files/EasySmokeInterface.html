          <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>Easy Smoke is an interface design for Kismet Hookah Lounge in Burnaby, BC which can be implemented in both the kiosk (3-simple steps) and mobile platform (accessible anywhere). It allows the user to create their account, see the menu and events, pre-order their hookah, and reserve a spot. Users can now easily reserve their spot without waiting in the long line-up and receive notification through phone text when the seat is ready.

        <h2> Problems </h2>
          <p>
            Kismet Hookah owners, were really interested in such technology and asked us to implement the system so it could be automatically sends the customer's order to the pad located by the cashier, so that they would have access to the billing payments of the customers.
            To do so we had to access the already existing technology within the store, which was a small iPad allowing the employees to record orders under each individual's name. When I saw them interested in this, I asked the owner to give me the information of the place where
            they got the iPad and the technology from. I contacted the company, and sadly didn't get any respond after couple of emails that I sent. Since, the project requirment was only to create a prototype interface, which does not have to work functionally, we decided to dismiss
            connecting to the system and continued with the design of the interface itself.

        <h2>Kiosk Idea</h2>

          <p>As a result of the data collection methods, I knew that Kismet Hookah was in need of a system that could better take care of a list of people in line and also provide better customer service.
            From the interviews, and observations that were taken place at the lounge, it was obvious that workers and employees find it tough to spot all the customer's inside the store and give their best service just right when the customer needs it.
            Therefore, during the interview I suggested that a kiosk design would solve the problem of keeping track of customers. The owners also felt pretty good about the idea and were hopping that they could finally get rid of writing customer's names on paper which had already brought problems like: loosing the paper and then dealing with angry customers afterward.

        <h2>User Testing</h2>

          <p>
            The interface being shown on the poster above displays first phase of the design which was complete but not finished yet. I was responsible for the design of the interface as my team mate was in control of the content for the pages.
            I designed the interface going through the steps and what the customers suggest to be useful. The most important part of the interface was to achieve a task in the most convinient way, with the least amount of time taken to be complete.
            I first came up with a journey framework that could answers the need of the customer as well as the need of the emplooyes.
            As expected many things were going a bit off with the interface, and some frustration were obvious during the user testing. This step helped me a lot to understand how a user navigate through an interface with different tasks that needs to be taken.
            The user testing, was a great way to understand how would an individual think, decides, and makes decisions on how to interact with a new technology.
