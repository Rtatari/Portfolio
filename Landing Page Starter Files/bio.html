        <h1> about me </h1>
          <p> I love to <em> code in html, css, javascript, </em> because they would allowe me to bring my imaginations and ideas into beautiful, high resolution, <em>screens in variaty of sizes</em>.
           </p>
          <p>
            Besides coding, I also enjoy working in groups and learn from individuals as they can suggest different views and bring different ideas into a project.
            More importantly what makes a good project is the process and the way that us designers deal with these problems. As a result, brainstorming, sketching, rendering, and iterating becomes very
            crucial aspects of a design project.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, I also enjoy working with models and bringing the initial idea into a more livable, physical product. This could be either 3D modelling using programs like Solidworks, and Maya,
            or just physical models made with foam choards.
